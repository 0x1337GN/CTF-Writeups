For this challenge, we receive a .sal file which is a Salae file that can be opened in the Logic2 software:

At first I tried to measure out the signal to figure out the baud rate but nothing came of it. Then I took a step back, or better said, zoomed in and then took a step back and a picture started being formed.

HTB

We can see HTB being formed by the signal channels themselves. Scrolling to the right we get more of the flag:

And so on until we write down the entire flag:

HTB{b391N_tH3_HArdWAr3_QU3St}
