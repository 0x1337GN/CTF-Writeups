### Solution
After unzipping, we get a lot, a lot of IOCs:

After looking at a couple of them, I can see they are all almost the same, the only difference seems to be this string that's checked:

I used the command below to carve out only that line from all of the files:
```bash
cat *|grep -r 'String.Equals(pass'
```
We can indeed see that they are all different:

But which one would it be?! ... we need to find the odd one out. The flag may be in this string but if it would be a hex encoded flag, it still wouldn't work because the line doesn't seem long enough. Let's find the longest one:
```bash
cat *|grep -r 'String.Equals(pass'|awk 'length > 80'
```
We find exactly one line so we must be getting closer:

I used this command to carve it out and hex decode it:
```bash
echo '666c6167-7b36-6365-3666-36613135646464623065-6262-3333-3262-66616632623064623065-6262-3333-3262-66616632623062383564-317d-0000-0000-000000000000'|sed 's/-//g'|xxd -r -p
```
