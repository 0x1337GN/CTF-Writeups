### Solution
I spent some time looking at the WAV file but didn't get anywhere. I started googling and found that the name of the challenge references a Commodore 64 thing. I first found references to the Danish band:

But their name is in fact a reference to this message you would sometimes get on the Commodore64.

I started searching to see how I can load the WAV file into an emulator online and found that I can convert the WAV file into a TAP file.

A nifty tool I found is this one: https://wav-prg.sourceforge.io/audiotap.html which allowed me to convert the file:

Now I searched for an online emulator for the console in order to use the TAP file generated by the app. The first result was helpful for me:

After uploading the TAP file into this emulator we can see the screen changing with a different message:

Another short while longer, we see it starts printing the flag continuosly.

From here we just transcribe it manually and get the points:
