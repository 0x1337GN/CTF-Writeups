I realized it would take too long to manually go through it all so I used this `wget` command to recursively download all the content into a folder:

```bash
wget -r --user opendir --password opendir http://chal.ctf.games:32688/
```
I then used `grep` to recursively search for the flag and show the line number and file in which the flag is located (force of habit):

```bash
grep -rna 'flag{'
```
