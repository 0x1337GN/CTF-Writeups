This was a month log CTF in which they released 2 challenges per day. In the last week it was only 1 per day. It was fun and kept me engaged throughout the month with nice challenges that helped me learn a lot and add some tools in my toolkit. Sadly I'm missing BlackCat 2 and Crab Rave.

I finished 100th out of 4212 teams playing solo.
